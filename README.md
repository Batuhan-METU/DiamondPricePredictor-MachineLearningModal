<h1 align="center">💎 Diamond Price Prediction App 💎</h1>

◐ This project predicts **diamond prices** using a cleaned and feature-engineered version of the Kaggle dataset. 
=> **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinmirzaie/diamonds-price-dataset**

◐ The process includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning modeling**, and finally deploying the model as a **web application**.  

◐ Users can input details such as **carat, cut, color, and clarity**, and instantly get a **predicted diamond price**.
